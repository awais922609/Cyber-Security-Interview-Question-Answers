<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>95. What is an insecure direct object reference? Why is it a problem?</strong></p>
<p>An insecure direct object reference (IDOR) occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input, such as file names or database keys. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions. It is a problem because it allows attackers to manipulate input, gaining access to data or functionality they should not have permission to access.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>96. Why is it important to validate redirects and forwards?</strong></p>
<p>Validating redirects and forwards is crucial to prevent attacks such as phishing or session theft. Without proper validation, attackers can craft malicious URLs to redirect users to fraudulent websites or manipulate forwards to access unauthorized pages. Validation helps ensure that redirects and forwards are legitimate and do not pose security risks.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>97. What are some common security vulnerabilities at the information storage level?</strong></p>
<p>Common security vulnerabilities at the information storage level include inadequate access controls, insufficient encryption of stored data, and vulnerabilities related to database management systems, such as SQL injection. Improper handling of sensitive data can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>98. What are some common security vulnerabilities at the transport level?</strong></p>
<p>Common security vulnerabilities at the transport level include man-in-the-middle attacks, insufficient encryption during data transmission, and vulnerabilities in network protocols. Without proper security measures, sensitive information transmitted over networks may be intercepted, leading to data compromise or unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>99. How can improper error handling expose security vulnerabilities? How?</strong></p>
<p>Improper error handling can expose security vulnerabilities by providing attackers with valuable information about the system's internal workings. Detailed error messages may reveal sensitive information or guide attackers in exploiting weaknesses. It's important to implement secure error handling practices, providing generic error messages to users while logging detailed error information for administrators.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>100. Can you give me a few examples of physical security integration?</strong></p>
<p>Examples of physical security integration include the combination of access control systems with video surveillance, integrating alarm systems with building automation systems, and incorporating biometric authentication into entry points. These integrations enhance overall security by combining various physical security measures.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>101. What is social engineering? How common is it?</strong></p>
<p>Social engineering is a form of manipulation that exploits human psychology to deceive individuals into divulging confidential information, providing access, or performing actions that may compromise security. Social engineering attacks are common and come in various forms, such as phishing emails, pretexting phone calls, or impersonation attempts. The effectiveness of these attacks often relies on exploiting trust and human behavior.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>102. How would you secure an office environment? What about a data center?</strong></p>
<p>To secure an office environment, measures may include access control systems, surveillance cameras, employee awareness training, and visitor management protocols. Data center security involves additional measures like biometric access controls, environmental monitoring, fire suppression systems, redundant power supplies, and strict access policies to protect critical infrastructure and sensitive information.</p

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p><strong>103. What is the incident response lifecycle according to NIST, and what are its four major phases?</strong></p>
<p>According to NIST, the incident response lifecycle consists of four major phases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Preparation</li>
  <li>Detection & Analysis</li>
  <li>Containment, Eradication & Recovery</li>
  <li>Post-Incident Activity</li>
</ol>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>106. What is the main course difference between vulnerability assessment and penetration testing?</strong></p>
<p>The primary distinction lies in their approach and level of engagement. Vulnerability assessment is a more passive process, focusing on identifying and categorizing vulnerabilities without actively exploiting them. In contrast, penetration testing involves simulating real-world attacks to actively exploit vulnerabilities, providing a more hands-on evaluation of the system's security posture.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>
<p><strong>107. Why do we create 2 files in splunk configuration? Input.conf and output.conf is created on splunkforwarder. what is the main difference between them</strong></p>
<p>Input.conf Tells the Splunk forwarder what data to collect. while output.conf Tells the Splunk forwarder where to send the collected data.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sources: Files or directories to monitor for new data.</li>
  <li>Metadata: Source, sourcetype, index, and other attributes to attach to the collected data.</li>
  <li>How to send the data to the Splunk infrastructure (directly to indexers or through other forwarders).</li>
</ol>

Output.conf
<ol>
  <li>Destinations: Hostname or IP address and port of the receiving Splunk instances.</li>
  <li>Groups: Logical groupings of destinations for easier configuration.</li>
  <li>Default settings: Routing and other options applicable to all data forwarding.</li>
</ol>
