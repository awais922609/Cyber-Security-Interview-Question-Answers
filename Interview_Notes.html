IPsec is commonly used for creating Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), ensuring confidentiality and secure data transmission between network devices.There are two modes of IPSEC:
1.Transport
2.Tunnel
·  Transport Mode:
In Transport Mode, only the payload (the actual data) of the IP packet is encrypted and/or authenticated. The IP header is left intact. Transport Mode is typically used for end-to-end communication between two hosts.
·  Tunnel Mode:
In Tunnel Mode, the entire IP packet (including the header) is encrypted and/or authenticated. The original packet is then encapsulated in a new IP packet with a new header. Tunnel Mode is commonly used for site-to-site VPNs, where entire networks are connected over a secure tunnel.
Question:
85. Does IPsec replace the need for SSL?
IPsec and SSL/TLS serve different purposes. While both provide secure communication, IPsec operates at the network layer, securing all traffic between two devices, while SSL/TLS operates at the application layer, securing specific applications (e.g., web browsers). Depending on the use case, organizations may choose one or both protocols to meet their security requirements.

109. Why do we create 2 files in splunk configuration? Input.conf and output.conf is created on splunkforwarder. what is the main difference between them
Input.conf Tells the Splunk forwarder what data to collect. while output.conf Tells the Splunk forwarder where to send the collected data.
1.Sources: Files or directories to monitor for new data.
2.Metadata: Source, sourcetype, index, and other attributes to attach to the collected data.
3.How to send the data to the Splunk infrastructure (directly to indexers or through other forwarders).
Output.conf 
1.Destinations: Hostname or IP address and port of the receiving Splunk instances.
2.Groups: Logical groupings of destinations for easier configuration.
3.Default settings: Routing and other options applicable to all data forwarding.
Question:
110.How is an infected machine disconnected from the network (Contamination) in case of SIEM Solution?
The process of contamination is performed with the help of agent which is installed on the endpoint. The SIEM Server sends message to the agent to block all services running on the endpoint and thus in this way the endpoint is isolated from the environment.
Question:
111.What is the difference between IOC (Indicator of compromise) vs IOA (Indicator of Attack) ?
IOCs are forensic artifacts or pieces of evidence that suggest a system or network has been breached or compromised.·Used to detect and confirm that a breach or malicious activity has already occurred.Examples include unexpected critical system changes, known malicious file signatures, log enteries that suggest unauthorized access.
IOAs are patterns or sequences of behavior that suggest an attack is in progress or is about to occur.Examples include Efforts to gain higher privileges on a system.scanning or probing of network ports or systems.
IOC: Post-compromise. Used to identify that an attack has already occurred.
IOA: Pre-compromise or during the attack. Used to detect and prevent an attack in progress.
Question:
112.What is AAA Security ?
Authentication, authorization, and accounting is a framework used to control and track access within a computer network.
 
Question:
113.What is Risk Management types ?
1. Risk Acceptance:
Definition: Accepting the risk means acknowledging that a particular risk exists and deciding not to take any action to reduce its impact or likelihood. This approach is often chosen when the cost of mitigating the risk is higher than the potential impact of the risk itself.
Example: A company might accept the risk of a non-critical system going down for a few hours because the cost of implementing a high-availability solution is too high relative to the impact of downtime.
2. Risk Mitigation:
Definition: Mitigating the risk involves taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk. This is often the most common approach to managing risks and includes implementing controls, procedures, or safeguards.
Example: Installing firewalls, encrypting data, and conducting regular security training to reduce the risk of cyberattacks.
3. Risk Transference:
Definition: Transferring the risk involves shifting the risk to another party, usually through insurance or outsourcing. This doesn't eliminate the risk but transfers the financial impact to another entity.
Example: Purchasing cyber insurance to cover the financial losses in case of a data breach, or outsourcing data storage to a third-party cloud provider with its own security measures.
4. Risk Avoidance:
Definition: Avoiding the risk means taking actions to eliminate the risk entirely. This often involves not engaging in activities that could expose the organization to the risk.
Example: A company might avoid the risk of data breaches by choosing not to collect or store certain types of sensitive information.
Question:
114.What is DORA Process ?
DORA stands for Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge and describes the process by which a client obtains an IP address from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.
Steps in the DORA Process:
Discover:
The client device sends a DHCP Discover message to identify available DHCP servers on the network. This message is broadcast because the client doesn't yet have an IP address.
Offer:
The DHCP server(s) respond with a DHCP Offer message. This message includes an available IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and other network configuration information.
Request:
The client responds with a DHCP Request message, indicating its acceptance of the offered IP address and requesting that the DHCP server reserve this address for it.
Acknowledge:
The DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledge (ACK) message to confirm that the IP address has been assigned to the client. The client can now use this IP address to communicate on the network.
